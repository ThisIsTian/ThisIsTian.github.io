Abstract: Photo-realistic subsurface scattering is a demanding feature in many real-time
                   applications, especially in next-generation games and virtual productions where the
                   uncanny valley needs to be addressed for real-time human skin rendering. Most
                   importantly, it must be addressed in milliseconds or less without visible quality
                   compromise. These quality and performance demands are prohibitively expensive
                   when using Monte Carlo sampling for subsurface scattering. Moreover, real-time
                   rendering is limited by hardware capability and GPU cache architectures. This
                   dissertation explores novel algorithms for high-quality photo-realistic real-time subsurface
                   scattering with cache incoherence and limited bandwidth.

                   &nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, a new generic taxonomy is proposed for heterogeneous realtime
                   rendering to identify techniques that can improve bandwidth and cache utilization.
                   A single pass, variance guided, and generic O(1) real-time adaptive sampling
                   technique is proposed to minimize bandwidth demands and improve cache utilization.
                   This adaptive sampling pass works with different global temporal accumulation
                   techniques (e.g., Temporal Anti-Aliasing and Deep Learning Super Sampling).
                   to further improve quality. We propose a new technique, adaptive filtered importance
                   sampling (AFIS), based on our single pass adaptive sampling technique and
                   filtered importance sampling. A hybrid AFIS and the separable approximation technique
                   allows the user to balance quality and performance. To deal with instability
                   during dynamic lighting, a novel use of Control Variates (CV) in the sample domain
                   instead of shading domain is proposed.
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;Our algorithm induces as little as one texture overhead to a real-time rendering
                   engine, and has been battle tested in the Unreal Engine, a commercial game engine.

<em>Abstract</em>: Photo-realistic subsurface scattering is a demanding feature in many real-time
                   applications, especially in next-generation games and virtual productions where the
                   uncanny valley needs to be addressed for real-time human skin rendering. Most
                   importantly, it must be addressed in milliseconds or less without visible quality
                   compromise. These quality and performance demands are prohibitively expensive
                   when using Monte Carlo sampling for subsurface scattering. Moreover, real-time
                   rendering is limited by hardware capability and GPU cache architectures. This
                   dissertation explores novel algorithms for high-quality photo-realistic real-time subsurface
                   scattering with cache incoherence and limited bandwidth.<br>

                   &nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, a new generic taxonomy is proposed for heterogeneous realtime
                   rendering to identify techniques that can improve bandwidth and cache utilization.
                   A single pass, variance guided, and generic O(1) real-time adaptive sampling
                   technique is proposed to minimize bandwidth demands and improve cache utilization.
                   This adaptive sampling pass works with different global temporal accumulation
                   techniques (e.g., Temporal Anti-Aliasing and Deep Learning Super Sampling).
                   to further improve quality. We propose a new technique, adaptive filtered importance
                   sampling (AFIS), based on our single pass adaptive sampling technique and
                   filtered importance sampling. A hybrid AFIS and the separable approximation technique
                   allows the user to balance quality and performance. To deal with instability
                   during dynamic lighting, a novel use of Control Variates (CV) in the sample domain
                   instead of shading domain is proposed.<br>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;Our algorithm induces as little as one texture overhead to a real-time rendering
                   engine, and has been battle tested in the Unreal Engine, a commercial game engine.</p>
